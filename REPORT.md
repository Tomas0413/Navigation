# Learning Algorithm

The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

# Plot of Rewards

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

# Ideas for Future Work

* I would like to use [Tensorboard for PyTorch](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX)
* I would like to spend some time and train an agent from raw pixels
* I would like to spend some time and compare the performance of the agent to (Double DQN)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461] and (Dueling DQN)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581]
* I'm also interested exploring (Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298]
* Also, a colleague of mine is learning Unity and created a simple game, I'd like to apply what I learned and solve this gave using RL
